            <h2>Some info about me...</h2>

            <div class="home text">
                <p>Morgan Pravato is a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park pursuing a double degree in journalism (broadcast) and dance. She has a passion for storytelling through multimedia and movement.</p>

                <h3>A Creative Statement</h3>

                <p>You always hear about a work-life balance, but I have been <em>living</em> for my "work" since I was 14 years old.</p>

                <p>I am happy to saw that I do not know the feeling of being trapped in the library to work on something that I am not absolutely in love with.
                  This obsession with my craft still defines me, even though Zoom dance classes give me persistent headaches.</p>

                <p>I am an entertainer at my core. I always hope to engage an audience whether through words or visuals onstage / on screen.
                  That could just be a fancy way of saying that I like attention, which might be true too.</p>

                <p>I never questioned whether I could balance being behind a camera and in front of an audience (when those were legal.) Actually, pursuing passions that are not obviously compatible
                  pushes my creative boundaries. I created my own journalism niche by tailoring coursework and employment opportunities to fit my hard reporting and creative sides.
                  Clearly, my inability to understand "no" clearly came in handy. That refusal to abandon any "side" of myself has now given me a unique perspective that I bring to every opportunity.</p>

                <p>My paths in these two fields may seem messy, but I thrive in the chaos. I continue to pursue journalism, digital communications and social media-related opportunities jointly with work in dance and
                  arts administration.</p>
