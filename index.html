            <h2>I see you've found me. Uh oh.</h2>

            <div class="home text">
                <p>Morgan is a rising senior at the University of Maryland, College Park pursuing a double degree in journalism (broadcast) and dance. Besides being a student,
                  she is an entertainment journalist, digital creator, dancer, and educator. She has a passion for storytelling through multimedia and movement.</p>

                <h3>How many college students use those labels and adjectives on job applications and in cover letters though?</h3>

                <h3>Boring.</h3>

                <p>Let’s get a bit deeper. Here’s who she is, how she got here, and where she wants to go.</p>

                <p id="thoughts">Ok, we're going to ditch this third-person nonsense because I absolutely cannot take myself seriously enough to keep it going.</p>

                <p>My path has been messy so far, but I thrive in the chaos. To be honest, I live the dream by doing what I love inside and outside the classroom everyday. I cannot
                  imagine staying cooped up in the library to study for a class that I am not absolutely in love with with. I live for the feeling of getting so lost in my work in the dance studio
                  or in the news bubble that I don't realize it's 1 a.m.</p>

                <p>When I was applying to colleges nearly four years ago, I never questioned whether I was going to balance my interest in
                  journalism with my love for dance. It was simply a matter of how I was going to manage working behind a camera and on a stage. Now, I know that pursuing passions that were not obviously compatible has pushed
                  the boundaries of my creativity - and my time management skills of course.   Arts and entertainment journalism is not taken seriously by everyone in Merrill College, so I made my own creative niche by tailoring coursework and
                  employment opportunities to appeal to both my hard reporting and creative sides. Now, I am especially proud to have a resume that boasts truly unique experiences. My work life may seem "all over the map" at first,
                  but my urge to create connects it all. It is obvious that I can deliver in any situation or for any assignment thrown at me, while always providing a unique perspective and a bit of humor.</p>

                <h3>Multimedia</h3>

                <p>As a journalist focued on entertainment, culture, and the arts, I balance serious and influential reporting with comical creativity. I tell the stories of student artists and reflect on the impact that Jersey Shore
                   had on my generation all in the same week for the same publication. I am fueled equally by my love for the arts and my stupid addiction to reality tv, TikTok, and other societal scum. I switch between these
                  "sides" with ease, which means some of my stories have had important impacts and others simply made people laugh. I write for college students on the daily, but I am no stranger to audiences with more serious expectations.
                  My dynamic voice makes me fit to create any digital content for virtually any audience.</p>

                <p>While I still love reporting, I continue to establish myself in the world of digital communications and marketing. I had full creative control over two social media accounts for different University of Maryland academic departments. I was
                  challenged to put forward professional content that was still attractive to college students and appropriate for the platforms. I redesigned their unattractive academic messages by planning, shooting, and editing my own photos/graphics/videos.
                  I even created a few memes along the way. I rapidly grew both accounts' audiences and engagement rates.</p>

                <p>I continue to strengthen both sides of my multimedia work. I am just as excited about arts advocacy as I am about showing how TikTok will be the next SoundCloud.</p>

                <h3>Dance</h3>

                <p>I began dancing at three years old, mainly training in modern styles, ballet, and tap. I do not feel like myself if I cannot move and groove every day. While an undergraduate student, I have worked under the mentorship of Adriane Fang.</p>

                <p>Since dance has had such an important impact on my life, I obviously use my writing and video skills to more thoroughly cover the arts in the DMV area. I value the educational power of my work and have pursued additional movement-related opportunities
                    to continue sharing the power of the arts. During the summer of 2019, I applied my training with Jody Arnold and Anne Biddle
                    at the Dance Education Laboratory to singlehandedly create and implement a day camp’s first performing arts program. Creating
                    a drama-dance hybrid curriculum for children ranging in age from 3-13 was one of my most rewarding professional experiences.
                    Seeing the power that daily artistic practice, a welcoming environment, and a dose of laughter had on children
                    re-inspired all aspects of my work.</p>

                <p>I move forward in my career knowing that I am the product of an odd combination of passions,
                  which allows me to be truly open to anything. At my core, I am an entertainer - I always hope to engage an audience whether that is through words or visuals onstage / on screen. I realize that's just a fancy way of saying that
                  I like attention. That may be true too.</p>

                <p>Interested in seeing more? Hopefully. This is only an overview of my passions and motivations. Check out my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> for more information about my experiences and skills.
