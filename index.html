            <h2>I see you've found me. Uh oh.</h2>

            <div class="home text">
                <p>Morgan is a rising senior at the University of Maryland, College Park pursuing a double degree in journalism (broadcast) and dance. Besides being a student,
                  she is an entertainment journalist, digital creator, dancer, and educator. She has a passion for storytelling through multimedia and movement.</p>

                <p>Wait, how many college students use those same, exact words to describe themselves?<b> Boring.</b></p>

                <p>Let’s get a bit deeper. Here’s who she is, how she got here, and where she wants to go.<div id="thoughts">Also, we're going to ditch this third-person nonsense
                  because I absolutely cannot take myself seriously enough to keep it going.</div></p>

                <h3>Creative Statement</h3>

                <p>I am constantly guided by my urge to create, tell stories, and entertain.</p>

                <p> Honestly, I'm living the dream inside and outside the classroom everyday. I will never know the feeling of being cooped up in the library to study for a class that I am not absolutely in love with. Instead, I get so immersed in my work in the dance studio
                  or in the news bubble that I don't realize it's 1 a.m. This obsession defines me, and has given me motivation and a full heart.
                You always hear about a work-life balance, but I have been <em>living</em> for my "work" since I was about 14 years old. Separating that important part of me would be like cutting my arm off - not gonna happen unless it
                gives me a lifetime supply of chicken parm.</p>

                <p>When applying to colleges, I never questioned whether I was going to balance an interest in
                  media with my love for dance. I just needed to figure out how to juggle being behind a screen and on a stage. Pursuing passions that were not obviously compatible has pushed
                  my creative boundaries - and my time management skills of course. My refusal to abandon any "side" of myself has given me an original perspective that I bring to every assignment and situation - along with a bit of humor.</p>

                <p>Arts and entertainment journalism is not taken seriously by everyone in Merrill College, so I made my own niche by tailoring coursework and
                  employment opportunities to fit my hard reporting and creative sides. My refusal to accept the word "no" clearly came in handy. The past three years were filled with truly unique work experiences;
                 some I created myself and others I pursued with great enthusiasm.</p>

                <p>My paths in these two fields may seem messy, but I just thrive in the chaos. I continue to pursue journalism, digitial communications and public relations opportunities jointly with dance and arts administration-related work. I also continue to
                  have a strong love for New Jersey and Christmas.</p>

                <h3>Multimedia</h3>

                <p>Clearly, asking me to focus on one thing just isn't possible. Sure this could be annoying, but it allows me to balance serious reporting with comical cultural analyses. I tell the stories of student artists and explain Jersey Shore's
                   impact on my generation all in the same week for the same publication. I continue to make an important impact on the DMV arts community and serve as a simple source of laughter for my audience.
                   Both results are equally as important to me.</p>

                <p>I write for college students daily, but I am no stranger to audiences with more serious expectations (as seen below.)
                  I can create written or visual content for virtually anyone thanks to my breadth of experiences (media or otherwise) and commanding eye for detail.</p>

                <p>While I still love reporting, I continue to establish myself in the world of social media marketing. I had full creative control over two social media accounts for different University of Maryland academic departments. I was
                  challenged to put forward professional content that was still attractive to college students and appropriate for the platforms. I redesigned their unattractive academic messages by planning, shooting, and editing my own photos/graphics/videos.
                  I even created a few memes along the way. I rapidly grew both accounts' audiences and engagement rates by appealing to their bases more effectively.</p>

                <h3>Dance</h3>

                <p>I began dancing at three years old, mainly training in modern styles, ballet, and tap. I do not feel like myself if I go a day without moving and grooving. While an undergraduate student, I have worked under the mentorship of Adriane Fang.</p>

                <p>Since dance has had such an important impact on my life, I obviously use my writing and video skills to more thoroughly cover the arts in the DMV area. I value the educational power of my work and have pursued additional movement-related opportunities
                    to continue sharing the power of the arts. During Summer 2019, I applied my training with Jody Arnold and Anne Biddle
                    at the Dance Education Laboratory to singlehandedly create and implement a day camp’s first performing arts program. Creating
                    a drama-dance hybrid curriculum for children ranging in age from 3-13 was one of my most rewarding professional experiences.
                    Seeing the power that daily artistic practice, a welcoming environment, and a dose of laughter had on children
                    re-inspired all aspects of my work.</p>

                <p>I know that I am the product of an odd combination of passions,
                  so I am truly open to anything. At my core, I am an entertainer - I always hope to engage an audience whether through words or visuals onstage / on screen. I realize that could just be a fancy way of saying that
                  I like attention. That might be true too.</p>
