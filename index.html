            <h2>Some info about me...</h2>

            <div class="home text">
                <p>Morgan Pravato is a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park pursuing a double degree in journalism (broadcast) and dance. She has a passion for storytelling through multimedia and movement.</p>

                <p>Let’s get deep. Here’s who she is, how she got here and where she wants to go.<div id="thoughts">Third-person nonsense will not continue after this point.</div></p>

                <h3>A Creative Statement</h3>

                <p>You always hear about a work-life balance, but I have been <em>living</em> for my "work" since I was about 14 years old.</p>

                <p> Being at the University of Maryland (pre-pandemic) gave me the opportunity to live the dream. I am unfamiliar with the feeling of being cooped up in the library to study
                  for a class that I am not absolutely in love with. Instead, I got so immersed in my work in the dance studio or in the news bubble that I never realized it was 1 a.m. This
                  obsession still defines me, even though Zoom dance classes give me persistent headaches.</p>

                <p>I never question whether I can balance being behind a camera and in front of an audience (when those are legal again.) Pursuing passions that are not obviously compatible
                  pushes my creative boundaries. My refusal to abandon any "side" of myself has given me an original perspective that I bring to every assignment and opportunity - along
                  with a bit of humor.</p>

                <p>College has been defined by unique work experiences; some I created myself and others I pursued with great enthusiasm. The arts are not taken seriously by everyone in Merrill College,
                  so I made my own niche by tailoring coursework and employment opportunities to fit my hard reporting and creative sides. My refusal to accept the word "no" clearly came in handy.</p>

                <p>My paths in these two fields may seem messy, but I thrive in the chaos. I continue to pursue journalism, digital communications and public relations opportunities jointly with dance and
                  arts administration-related work.</p>

                <p>I may be the product of an odd combination of passions, but I am an entertainer at my core. I always hope to engage an audience whether through words or visuals onstage / on screen.
                  I realize that could just be a fancy way of saying that I like attention. That might be true too.</p>

                <p id="ending">Interested in seeing more? Hopefully. This is only an overview of my accomplishments and motivations. Enjoy your stay, and stay connected once you leave.</p>
