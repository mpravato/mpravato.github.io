              <p>I began dancing at three years old, mainly training in modern styles, tap and ballet over the years. I do not feel like myself if I go a day without moving and grooving.
                While an undergraduate student, I have worked under the mentorship of Adriane Fang, Crystal Davis and Alvin Mayes.</p>

              <p>Since dance has such an important impact on my life, I use my writing and video skills to more thoroughly cover the arts in the DMV area.
                Learning Laban Movement Analysis and Labanotation has also influenced my choreographic research and lesson plan structures.
                I value the educational power of my work and continue sharing the power of the arts.</p>

              <p>During Summer 2019, I applied my training with Jody Arnold and Anne Biddle at the Dance Education Laboratory to singlehandedly create and implement a day camp’s first performing arts program.
                Creating a drama-dance hybrid curriculum for children ranging in age from 3-13 was one of my most rewarding professional experiences. Seeing the power that daily artistic practice, a welcoming environment,
                and a dose of laughter had on children re-inspired all aspects of my work.</p>
