              </ul>

              <p>Studied at: Pure Movement Dance Center and Watchung Hills Regional High School</p>
              <p>Studied with: Dana Millette, Lindsay Doris, Marisa Joshi and Annanda Carmody</p>

              <p>I started dancing at three, but I began seriously pursuing the craft at 14 years old under the guidance of Dana Millette and Lindsay Doris at Pure Movement Dance Center.
                I continued to study tap (my longtime love) while also training in ballet, "contemporary" and modern dance. As my training got more intense, I was consumed by the dance competition world.
                I would come home from six hours of rehearsal and seven hours of school to continue stretching before starting my homework (sorry Mom.) How could I hit my quadruple turn? How could I get my leg to be the highest?
                My competitive nature mixed with my love for dance, and I was obviously obsessed. Competitions are still some of my most special memories.</p>

            <p>I completed all dance-related courses in Marisa Joshi's program during my four years at Watchung Hills, and was inducted into the National Honor Society for Dance Arts. At WH, I began my deep-dive into
              the world of modern dance and studied Horton, Graham and Cunningham techniques. Joshi exposed me to the artistic and expressive side of dance, which went beyond the physical side that I knew so well from competitions.
              I only fell more deeply in love. I also learned the basics of Laban Movement Analysis and Labanotation, which influence my research in higher education now. I took my first composition courses with Joshi too, and got my first choreogrpahic opportunities
              through the Dance Ensemble. I choreographed a solo and two group pieces as a member for all four years , one of which was shown and adjuticated at the Somerset County Teen Arts Festival at Raritan Valley Community College.</p>

            <p>These years of training were critical in my decision to pursue dance in college. The amazing moments with my dance team as "Captain Morgan" and as a member of Dance Ensemble
              were also the first to show me how dance builds an incredible community.</p>
