    <h2>Media Experience</h2>
      <h3>Marketing and Events Undergraduate Assistant</h3>
      <h4>University of Maryland's College of Arts and Humanities</h4>
      <h5>August 2019 – December 2019</h5>
      <p>I wrote and edited content to tell the stories of ARHU students and
        staff for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and the College's website. This
        often required me to conduct research and interview professionals to gain
        the background information required for content creation. I also maintained
        the editorial and events calendars in order to plan future posts and track
        past ones.</p>

      <h3>Staff Writer</h3>
      <h4>Unwind Magazine</h4>
      <h5>January 2019 – May 2019</h5>
      <p>I wrote stories for digital and print on student-held events and
        professional performances on campus. I also began a series of profiles on
        active students in various campus arts groups.</p>

      <h3>Staff Writer</h3>
      <h4>The Diamondback - Diversions</h4>
      <h5>September 2018 - Present</h5>
      <p>I report on arts and entertainment events occurring on the University of
        Maryland campus and in the D.C. area. This includes covering industry-related
        events and writing reviews on albums, movies, television shows, and art
        installations created by students and professionals. I have contributed to
        both the visual arts and television/movie beats. I also assist with planning
        content for the Diversions section podcast, "The Dive."</p>

    <h2>Dance Experience</h2>
      <h3>Performance Specialist</h3>
      <h4>Camp Riverbend</h4>
      <h5>June 2019 – August 2019</h5>
      <p>I designed and implemented the camp’s first performance curriculum to
        combine dance, drama, and music into an introductory experience. I taught the
        lessons to 500 children ranging from 4-13 years old. I catered to campers within
        the groups of drastically mixed levels. Children who had zero performance experience
        participated alongside those who have taken classes for years.</p>

      <h4>Second Season: “Doubled Bodies” - School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance
