            <h2>Media Experience</h2>
            <h3>Dance Marketing Intern</h3>
                <h4>School of Theatre, Dance and Performance Studies</h4>
                <h5>January 2020 - Present</h5>
                <p>I produce written and photo content for the dance department on Instagram and
                  Facebook that focus on daily happenings and event promotion. I also maintain
                  the editorial and events calendars with a system that I designed to meet the needs
                  of the team, and the community we feature. I am also leading a project to expand
                  the department's online audience by engaging with content from local and state high
                  school dance programs.</p>

            <h3>Marketing and Events Undergraduate Assistant</h3>
                <h4>University of Maryland's College of Arts and Humanities</h4>
                <h5>August 2019 – December 2019</h5>
                <p>I wrote and edited content to tell the stories of ARHU students and
                  staff for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and the College's website. This
                  often required me to conduct research and interview professionals to gain
                  the background information required for content creation. I also maintained
                  the editorial and events calendars in order to plan future posts and track
                  past ones.</p>

            <h3>Staff Writer</h3>
                <h4>Unwind Magazine</h4>
                <h5>January 2019 – May 2019</h5>
                <p>I wrote stories for digital and print on student-held events and
                  professional performances on campus. I also began a series of profiles on
                  active students in various campus arts groups.</p>

            <h3>Staff Writer</h3>
                <h4>The Diamondback - Diversions</h4>
                <h5>September 2018 - Present</h5>
                <p>I report on arts and entertainment events occurring on the University of
                  Maryland campus and in the D.C. area. This includes covering industry-related
                  events and writing reviews on albums, movies, television shows, and art
                  installations created by students and professionals. I have contributed to
                  both the visual arts and television/movie beats. I also assist with planning
                  content for the Diversions section podcast, "The Dive."</p>

            <h2>Dance Experience</h2>
                <h3>Performance Specialist</h3>
                <h4>Camp Riverbend</h4>
                <h5>June 2019 – August 2019</h5>
                <p>I designed and implemented the camp’s first performance curriculum to
                  combine dance, drama, and music into an introductory experience. I taught the
                  lessons to 500 children ranging from 4-13 years old. I catered to campers within
                  the groups of drastically mixed levels. Children who had zero performance experience
                  participated alongside those who have taken classes for years.</p>
