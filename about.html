            <blockquote>Thoughtful and resilient student focused on writing, videography, and movement.
                Educating, pushing boundaries, and exploring through this seemingly odd combination.</blockquote>

            <p>I am a student, entertainment journalist, dancer, and educator. How many college students
                use those same labels in job applications and cover letters though? Boring.
                Let’s get a bit deeper. Here’s how I got to where I am, and where I want to go.</p>

            <p>My career path so far has been messy, and I wouldn’t want it to be any neater. I have traveled
                down an uncleared trail of performing arts and journalism related pursuits, always guided by my urge to create.
                My breadth of experience has allowed me to deliver for any job or assignment thrown at me, and always provide a
                unique perspective.</p>

            <p>I have been dancing since I was three, mainly training in modern forms, ballet, and top.
                I don't feel like myself if I can't move and groove every day. Since dance has had such an important impact on my life,
                I use my writing and video skills to more thoroughly cover the arts in the DMV area.</p>

            <p>I value the educational power that my multimedia work has, and I have pursued additional opportunities
                to help share the power of the arts. During the summer of 2019, I had the invaluable opportunity of singlehandedly
                creating a drama-dance hybrid curriculum for children ranging in age from 3-13. Being a performance specialist
                was one of the most rewarding professional experiences that I have had. I felt re-inspired in all aspects
                of my work after seeing the power that daily artistic practice, a welcoming environment,
                and a dose of laughter had on children.</p>

            <p>Whether through multimedia or movement, my work always includes a bit of humor.
                A Morgan Pravato Product™ is not complete without it.</p>

            <p>As a journalist, I balance serious, influential reporting with comical creativity.
                I have the joy of helping increase student artists' audiences and reflecting on the impact that
                Jersey Shore has had on my generation all in the same week for the same publications.</p>

            <p>I have also enjoyed diving into the world of digital communications and marketing.
                I manage social media accounts with the challenge of putting forward professional
                content that is still attractive to college students and appropriate for the platforms.</p>

            <p>I move forward in my career knowing that I am the product of an odd combination of passions,
                which allows me to be open to anything. While I appreciate my comfort in entertainment reporting and the performing arts world,
                I am not tethered to either of these broad realms. I actually really want to help produce Shark Week before I die,
                so please refer to my “Portfolio” if you happen to be connected/know people at the Discovery, Inc.</p>

            <p>More specifically, I am currently pursuing positions involving social media management, marketing, and digital communications
                (related or unrelated to the arts.)</p>
