            <blockquote>Thoughtful and resilient student focused on writing, videography, and movement.
                Educating, pushing boundaries, and exploring through this seemingly odd combination.</blockquote>

            <p>Morgan is a student, entertainment journalist, dancer, and educator. How many college students
                use those same labels on job applications and in cover letters though? Let’s get a bit deeper.
                Here’s how she got to where she is, and where she wants to go.</p>

            <p>Her career path so far has been messy, and she wouldn’t it any neater. She has traveled
                down an uncleared trail of performing arts and journalism related pursuits, always guided by her urge to create.
                Her breadth of experience has allowed her to deliver for any job or assignment thrown at her, and always provide a
                unique perspective.</p>

            <p>Morgan began dancing at three years old, mainly training in modern forms, ballet, and tap.
                She does not feel like herself if she cannot move and groove every day. Since dance has had such an important impact on her life,
                she uses her writing and video skills to more thoroughly cover the arts in the DMV area.</p>

            <p>Morgan values the educational power of her multimedia work and has pursued additional opportunities
                to help share the power of the arts. During the summer of 2019, she applied her training with Jody Arnold and Anne Biddle
                at the Dance Education Laboratory to singlehandedly create and implement a day camp’s first performing arts program. Creating
                a drama-dance hybrid curriculum for children ranging in age from 3-13 was one her most rewarding professional experiences.
                Seeing the power that daily artistic practice, a welcoming environment, and a dose of laughter had on children
                re-inspired all aspects of her work.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Whether through multimedia or movement, her work always includes a bit of humor.
                A Morgan Pravato Product™ is not complete without it.</p>

            <p>As a journalist, Morgan balances serious, influential reporting with comical creativity. She has the joy
              of helping increase student artists' audiences and reflecting on the impact that Jersey Shore has had on her generation
              all in the same week for the same publications.</p>

            <p>Morgan has also enjoyed diving into the world of digital communications and marketing.
                She manages social media accounts with the challenge of putting forward professional
                content that is still attractive to college students and appropriate for the platforms.</p>

            <p>Morgan moves forward in her career knowing that she is the product of an odd combination of passions,
                which allows her to be open to anything. While she loves entertainment reporting and the performing arts world,
                she actually really wants to help produce Shark Week before she dies,
                so please refer to her “Portfolio” if you happen to be connected/know people at the Discovery, Inc.</p>
